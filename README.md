# CrewCall

CrewCall is a Progressive Web App (PWA) written with the Ruby on Rails framework. It is an onboarding platform to connect Producers with Film/Media freelance crew.

The app is live at https://crew-call.herokuapp.com

## About

CrewCall is a final project as part of [Le Wagon](https://github.com/lewagon)'s Full Stack Web Development bootcamp (Batch #512, Singapore).

It was initially pitched by Iqbal in response to his difficulties onboarding freelance crew members to his projects within a short period of time, and the amount of tedious work needed to get them started.

The app aims to improve Producers' productivity by streamling the processes involved in forming a crew for a project.
